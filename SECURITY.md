## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: security@futureforwardconsultancy.com
3. Include detailed information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-3 days
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next release cycle

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Run `npm audit` before releases
   - Use `npm audit fix` for automatic fixes

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `.env.example` for templates
   - Store secrets in secure vaults

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement proper authentication for admin routes
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Enable CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting

4. **API Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize user data
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use parameterized queries

5. **Code Quality**
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
   - Regular code reviews
   - Static analysis tools
   - Linting and formatting

### For Deployment

1. **HTTPS/SSL**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Use SSL certificates from trusted CAs
   - Implement HSTS headers

2. **Headers**
   ```javascript
   // Add to next.config.js
   headers: async () => [
     {
       source: '/:path*',
       headers: [
         {
           key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',
           value: 'on'
         },
         {
           key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
           value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload'
         },
         {
           key: 'X-Frame-Options',
           value: 'SAMEORIGIN'
         },
         {
           key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
           value: 'nosniff'
         },
         {
           key: 'X-XSS-Protection',
           value: '1; mode=block'
         },
         {
           key: 'Referrer-Policy',
           value: 'origin-when-cross-origin'
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on API routes
   - Protect against DDoS attacks
   - Monitor unusual traffic patterns

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry)
   - Monitor suspicious activities
   - Regular security audits
   - Log important events

## Known Security Considerations

### Admin Dashboard
- **Current State**: No authentication (mocked)
- **Action Required**: Implement proper authentication before production
- **Recommendation**: Use NextAuth.js or similar

### API Routes
- **Current State**: Basic validation
- **Action Required**: Add rate limiting and enhanced validation
- **Recommendation**: Implement API key authentication

### Contact Form
- **Current State**: Basic email validation
- **Action Required**: Add CAPTCHA to prevent spam
- **Recommendation**: Implement reCAPTCHA v3

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Enable HTTPS/SSL
- [ ] Add authentication to admin dashboard

- [ ] Sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] Regular security audits

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. Report received and acknowledged
2. Vulnerability verified and assessed
